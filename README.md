# blackjack
It's a practice on my javascript skill, which shows the game of casino blackjack abiding it's fundamental rules
It follows the rule of blackajck with little alteration
The kings,heart, and queen still have their values as 10 and ace can be 1 or 11 depending on the condition
Ace will be 11 if it won' exceed 42 when the card is sum together and 1 if if it will
The highest score for this game is 42, exceeding it means you loose
Their are four button there
New gane to start a new game
Cancel to cancel the current game
Hit to pick a card
Stay for the dealer to pick a card
Yield to admit defeat and share 40% from his bet
Once the new game button is hit, the player and the dealer will be shared two cards each
